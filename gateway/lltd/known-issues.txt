Known Issues - LLTD Implementers Guide and Microsoft Windows Rally Development Kit
October 30, 2006

Issues:
1. Veritool protocol verification tests 8.6 and 8.13 currently fail when run against LLTD-PK-RCzero. These failures have no known impact on LLTD functionality (topology mapping or bandwidth estimation). [Fix ETA: RC1]
2. ARPs are not being processed by the Windows Vista mapping engine, nor in the LLTD-PK-RCzero responder implementation.  These will appear in the responder sees-list in a future version (version TBD).
