Subject: [PATCH] do_generic_file_read: clear page errors when issuing a fresh read of the page

I/O errors can happen due to temporary failures, like multipath
errors or losing network contact with the iSCSI server. Because
of that, the VM will retry readpage on the page.

However, do_generic_file_read does not clear PG_error.  This
causes the system to be unable to actually use the data in the
page cache page, even if the subsequent readpage completes
successfully!

The function filemap_fault has had a ClearPageError before
readpage forever.  This patch simply adds the same to
do_generic_file_read.
