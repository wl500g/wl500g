Subject: [PATCH] af_unix: Only allow recv on connected seqpacket sockets.

This fixes the following oops discovered by Dan Aloni:

The bug was that unix domain sockets use a pseduo packet for
connecting and accept uses that psudo packet to get the socket.
In the buggy seqpacket case we were allowing unconnected
sockets to call recvmsg and try to receive the pseudo packet.

That is always wrong and as of commit 7361c36c5 the pseudo
packet had become enough different from a normal packet
that the kernel started oopsing.

Do for seqpacket_recv what was done for seqpacket_send in 2.5
and only allow it on connected seqpacket sockets.
