+Kernel Memory Leak Detector
+===========================
+
+Introduction
+------------
+
+Kmemleak provides a way of detecting possible kernel memory leaks in a
+way similar to a tracing garbage collector
+(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_%28computer_science%29#Tracing_garbage_collectors),
+with the difference that the orphan objects are not freed but only
+reported via /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak. A similar method is used by the
+Valgrind tool (memcheck --leak-check) to detect the memory leaks in
+user-space applications.
+
+Usage
+-----
+
+CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK in "Kernel hacking" has to be enabled. A kernel
+thread scans the memory every 10 minutes (by default) and prints the
+number of new unreferenced objects found. To display the details of all
+the possible memory leaks:
+
+  # mount -t debugfs nodev /sys/kernel/debug/
+  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak
+
+To trigger an intermediate memory scan:
+
+  # echo scan > /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak
+
+To clear the list of all current possible memory leaks:
+
+  # echo clear > /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak
+
+New leaks will then come up upon reading /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak
+again.
+
+Note that the orphan objects are listed in the order they were allocated
+and one object at the beginning of the list may cause other subsequent
+objects to be reported as orphan.
+
+Memory scanning parameters can be modified at run-time by writing to the
+/sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak file. The following parameters are supported:
+
+  off		- disable kmemleak (irreversible)
+  stack=on	- enable the task stacks scanning (default)
+  stack=off	- disable the tasks stacks scanning
+  scan=on	- start the automatic memory scanning thread (default)
+  scan=off	- stop the automatic memory scanning thread
+  scan=<secs>	- set the automatic memory scanning period in seconds
+		  (default 600, 0 to stop the automatic scanning)
+  scan		- trigger a memory scan
+  clear		- clear list of current memory leak suspects, done by
+		  marking all current reported unreferenced objects grey
+  dump=<addr>	- dump information about the object found at <addr>
+
+Kmemleak can also be disabled at boot-time by passing "kmemleak=off" on
+the kernel command line.
+
+Memory may be allocated or freed before kmemleak is initialised and
+these actions are stored in an early log buffer. The size of this buffer
+is configured via the CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_EARLY_LOG_SIZE option.
+
+Basic Algorithm
+---------------
+
+The memory allocations via kmalloc, vmalloc, kmem_cache_alloc and
+friends are traced and the pointers, together with additional
+information like size and stack trace, are stored in a prio search tree.
+The corresponding freeing function calls are tracked and the pointers
+removed from the kmemleak data structures.
+
+An allocated block of memory is considered orphan if no pointer to its
+start address or to any location inside the block can be found by
+scanning the memory (including saved registers). This means that there
+might be no way for the kernel to pass the address of the allocated
+block to a freeing function and therefore the block is considered a
+memory leak.
+
+The scanning algorithm steps:
+
+  1. mark all objects as white (remaining white objects will later be
+     considered orphan)
+  2. scan the memory starting with the data section and stacks, checking
+     the values against the addresses stored in the prio search tree. If
+     a pointer to a white object is found, the object is added to the
+     gray list
+  3. scan the gray objects for matching addresses (some white objects
+     can become gray and added at the end of the gray list) until the
+     gray set is finished
+  4. the remaining white objects are considered orphan and reported via
+     /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak
+
+Some allocated memory blocks have pointers stored in the kernel's
+internal data structures and they cannot be detected as orphans. To
+avoid this, kmemleak can also store the number of values pointing to an
+address inside the block address range that need to be found so that the
+block is not considered a leak. One example is __vmalloc().
+
+Testing specific sections with kmemleak
+---------------------------------------
+
+Upon initial bootup your /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak output page may be
+quite extensive. This can also be the case if you have very buggy code
+when doing development. To work around these situations you can use the
+'clear' command to clear all reported unreferenced objects from the
+/sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak output. By issuing a 'scan' after a 'clear'
+you can find new unreferenced objects; this should help with testing
+specific sections of code.
+
+To test a critical section on demand with a clean kmemleak do:
+
+  # echo clear > /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak
+  ... test your kernel or modules ...
+  # echo scan > /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak
+
+Then as usual to get your report with:
+
+  # cat /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak
+
+Kmemleak API
+------------
+
+See the include/linux/kmemleak.h header for the functions prototype.
+
+kmemleak_init		 - initialize kmemleak
+kmemleak_alloc		 - notify of a memory block allocation
+kmemleak_free		 - notify of a memory block freeing
+kmemleak_not_leak	 - mark an object as not a leak
+kmemleak_ignore		 - do not scan or report an object as leak
+kmemleak_scan_area	 - add scan areas inside a memory block
+kmemleak_no_scan	 - do not scan a memory block
+kmemleak_erase		 - erase an old value in a pointer variable
+kmemleak_alloc_recursive - as kmemleak_alloc but checks the recursiveness
+kmemleak_free_recursive	 - as kmemleak_free but checks the recursiveness
+
+Dealing with false positives/negatives
+--------------------------------------
+
+The false negatives are real memory leaks (orphan objects) but not
+reported by kmemleak because values found during the memory scanning
+point to such objects. To reduce the number of false negatives, kmemleak
+provides the kmemleak_ignore, kmemleak_scan_area, kmemleak_no_scan and
+kmemleak_erase functions (see above). The task stacks also increase the
+amount of false negatives and their scanning is not enabled by default.
+
+The false positives are objects wrongly reported as being memory leaks
+(orphan). For objects known not to be leaks, kmemleak provides the
+kmemleak_not_leak function. The kmemleak_ignore could also be used if
+the memory block is known not to contain other pointers and it will no
+longer be scanned.
+
+Some of the reported leaks are only transient, especially on SMP
+systems, because of pointers temporarily stored in CPU registers or
+stacks. Kmemleak defines MSECS_MIN_AGE (defaulting to 1000) representing
+the minimum age of an object to be reported as a memory leak.
+
+Limitations and Drawbacks
+-------------------------
+
+The main drawback is the reduced performance of memory allocation and
+freeing. To avoid other penalties, the memory scanning is only performed
+when the /sys/kernel/debug/kmemleak file is read. Anyway, this tool is
+intended for debugging purposes where the performance might not be the
+most important requirement.
+
+To keep the algorithm simple, kmemleak scans for values pointing to any
+address inside a block's address range. This may lead to an increased
+number of false negatives. However, it is likely that a real memory leak
+will eventually become visible.
+
+Another source of false negatives is the data stored in non-pointer
+values. In a future version, kmemleak could only scan the pointer
+members in the allocated structures. This feature would solve many of
+the false negative cases described above.
+
+The tool can report false positives. These are cases where an allocated
+block doesn't need to be freed (some cases in the init_call functions),
+the pointer is calculated by other methods than the usual container_of
+macro or the pointer is stored in a location not scanned by kmemleak.
+
+Page allocations and ioremap are not tracked. Only the ARM and x86
+architectures are currently supported.

+ *
+ * Notes on locking
+ * ----------------
+ *
+ * The following locks and mutexes are used by kmemleak:
+ *
+ * - kmemleak_lock (rwlock): protects the object_list modifications and
+ *   accesses to the object_tree_root. The object_list is the main list
+ *   holding the metadata (struct kmemleak_object) for the allocated memory
+ *   blocks. The object_tree_root is a priority search tree used to look-up
+ *   metadata based on a pointer to the corresponding memory block.  The
+ *   kmemleak_object structures are added to the object_list and
+ *   object_tree_root in the create_object() function called from the
+ *   kmemleak_alloc() callback and removed in delete_object() called from the
+ *   kmemleak_free() callback
+ * - kmemleak_object.lock (spinlock): protects a kmemleak_object. Accesses to
+ *   the metadata (e.g. count) are protected by this lock. Note that some
+ *   members of this structure may be protected by other means (atomic or
+ *   kmemleak_lock). This lock is also held when scanning the corresponding
+ *   memory block to avoid the kernel freeing it via the kmemleak_free()
+ *   callback. This is less heavyweight than holding a global lock like
+ *   kmemleak_lock during scanning
+ * - scan_mutex (mutex): ensures that only one thread may scan the memory for
+ *   unreferenced objects at a time. The gray_list contains the objects which
+ *   are already referenced or marked as false positives and need to be
+ *   scanned. This list is only modified during a scanning episode when the
+ *   scan_mutex is held. At the end of a scan, the gray_list is always empty.
+ *   Note that the kmemleak_object.use_count is incremented when an object is
+ *   added to the gray_list and therefore cannot be freed. This mutex also
+ *   prevents multiple users of the "kmemleak" debugfs file together with
+ *   modifications to the memory scanning parameters including the scan_thread
+ *   pointer
+ *
+ * The kmemleak_object structures have a use_count incremented or decremented
+ * using the get_object()/put_object() functions. When the use_count becomes
+ * 0, this count can no longer be incremented and put_object() schedules the
+ * kmemleak_object freeing via an RCU callback. All calls to the get_object()
+ * function must be protected by rcu_read_lock() to avoid accessing a freed
+ * structure.
