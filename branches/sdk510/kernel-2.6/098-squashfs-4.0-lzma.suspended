+SQUASHFS 4.0 FILESYSTEM
+=======================
+
+Squashfs is a compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.
+It uses zlib/lzo/xz compression to compress files, inodes and directories.
+Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise
+data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum
+of 1Mbytes (default block size 128K).
+
+Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for archival
+use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in constrained
+block device/memory systems (e.g. embedded systems) where low overhead is
+needed.
+
+Mailing list: squashfs-devel@lists.sourceforge.net
+Web site: www.squashfs.org
+
+1. FILESYSTEM FEATURES
+----------------------
+
+Squashfs filesystem features versus Cramfs:
+
+				Squashfs		Cramfs
+
+Max filesystem size:		2^64			256 MiB
+Max file size:			~ 2 TiB			16 MiB
+Max files:			unlimited		unlimited
+Max directories:		unlimited		unlimited
+Max entries per directory:	unlimited		unlimited
+Max block size:			1 MiB			4 KiB
+Metadata compression:		yes			no
+Directory indexes:		yes			no
+Sparse file support:		yes			no
+Tail-end packing (fragments):	yes			no
+Exportable (NFS etc.):		yes			no
+Hard link support:		yes			no
+"." and ".." in readdir:	yes			no
+Real inode numbers:		yes			no
+32-bit uids/gids:		yes			no
+File creation time:		yes			no
+Xattr support:			yes			no
+ACL support:			no			no
+
+Squashfs compresses data, inodes and directories.  In addition, inode and
+directory data are highly compacted, and packed on byte boundaries.  Each
+compressed inode is on average 8 bytes in length (the exact length varies on
+file type, i.e. regular file, directory, symbolic link, and block/char device
+inodes have different sizes).
+
+2. USING SQUASHFS
+-----------------
+
+As squashfs is a read-only filesystem, the mksquashfs program must be used to
+create populated squashfs filesystems.  This and other squashfs utilities
+can be obtained from http://www.squashfs.org.  Usage instructions can be
+obtained from this site also.
+
+The squashfs-tools development tree is now located on kernel.org
+	git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/fs/squashfs/squashfs-tools.git
+
+3. SQUASHFS FILESYSTEM DESIGN
+-----------------------------
+
+A squashfs filesystem consists of a maximum of nine parts, packed together on a
+byte alignment:
+
+	 ---------------
+	|  superblock 	|
+	|---------------|
+	|  compression  |
+	|    options    |
+	|---------------|
+	|  datablocks   |
+	|  & fragments  |
+	|---------------|
+	|  inode table	|
+	|---------------|
+	|   directory	|
+	|     table     |
+	|---------------|
+	|   fragment	|
+	|    table      |
+	|---------------|
+	|    export     |
+	|    table      |
+	|---------------|
+	|    uid/gid	|
+	|  lookup table	|
+	|---------------|
+	|     xattr     |
+	|     table	|
+	 ---------------
+
+Compressed data blocks are written to the filesystem as files are read from
+the source directory, and checked for duplicates.  Once all file data has been
+written the completed inode, directory, fragment, export, uid/gid lookup and
+xattr tables are written.
+
+3.1 Compression options
+-----------------------
+
+Compressors can optionally support compression specific options (e.g.
+dictionary size).  If non-default compression options have been used, then
+these are stored here.
+
+3.2 Inodes
+----------
+
+Metadata (inodes and directories) are compressed in 8Kbyte blocks.  Each
+compressed block is prefixed by a two byte length, the top bit is set if the
+block is uncompressed.  A block will be uncompressed if the -noI option is set,
+or if the compressed block was larger than the uncompressed block.
+
+Inodes are packed into the metadata blocks, and are not aligned to block
+boundaries, therefore inodes overlap compressed blocks.  Inodes are identified
+by a 48-bit number which encodes the location of the compressed metadata block
+containing the inode, and the byte offset into that block where the inode is
+placed (<block, offset>).
+
+To maximise compression there are different inodes for each file type
+(regular file, directory, device, etc.), the inode contents and length
+varying with the type.
+
+To further maximise compression, two types of regular file inode and
+directory inode are defined: inodes optimised for frequently occurring
+regular files and directories, and extended types where extra
+information has to be stored.
+
+3.3 Directories
+---------------
+
+Like inodes, directories are packed into compressed metadata blocks, stored
+in a directory table.  Directories are accessed using the start address of
+the metablock containing the directory and the offset into the
+decompressed block (<block, offset>).
+
+Directories are organised in a slightly complex way, and are not simply
+a list of file names.  The organisation takes advantage of the
+fact that (in most cases) the inodes of the files will be in the same
+compressed metadata block, and therefore, can share the start block.
+Directories are therefore organised in a two level list, a directory
+header containing the shared start block value, and a sequence of directory
+entries, each of which share the shared start block.  A new directory header
+is written once/if the inode start block changes.  The directory
+header/directory entry list is repeated as many times as necessary.
+
+Directories are sorted, and can contain a directory index to speed up
+file lookup.  Directory indexes store one entry per metablock, each entry
+storing the index/filename mapping to the first directory header
+in each metadata block.  Directories are sorted in alphabetical order,
+and at lookup the index is scanned linearly looking for the first filename
+alphabetically larger than the filename being looked up.  At this point the
+location of the metadata block the filename is in has been found.
+The general idea of the index is to ensure only one metadata block needs to be
+decompressed to do a lookup irrespective of the length of the directory.
+This scheme has the advantage that it doesn't require extra memory overhead
+and doesn't require much extra storage on disk.
+
+3.4 File data
+-------------
+
+Regular files consist of a sequence of contiguous compressed blocks, and/or a
+compressed fragment block (tail-end packed block).   The compressed size
+of each datablock is stored in a block list contained within the
+file inode.
+
+To speed up access to datablocks when reading 'large' files (256 Mbytes or
+larger), the code implements an index cache that caches the mapping from
+block index to datablock location on disk.
+
+The index cache allows Squashfs to handle large files (up to 1.75 TiB) while
+retaining a simple and space-efficient block list on disk.  The cache
+is split into slots, caching up to eight 224 GiB files (128 KiB blocks).
+Larger files use multiple slots, with 1.75 TiB files using all 8 slots.
+The index cache is designed to be memory efficient, and by default uses
+16 KiB.
+
+3.5 Fragment lookup table
+-------------------------
+
+Regular files can contain a fragment index which is mapped to a fragment
+location on disk and compressed size using a fragment lookup table.  This
+fragment lookup table is itself stored compressed into metadata blocks.
+A second index table is used to locate these.  This second index table for
+speed of access (and because it is small) is read at mount time and cached
+in memory.
+
+3.6 Uid/gid lookup table
+------------------------
+
+For space efficiency regular files store uid and gid indexes, which are
+converted to 32-bit uids/gids using an id look up table.  This table is
+stored compressed into metadata blocks.  A second index table is used to
+locate these.  This second index table for speed of access (and because it
+is small) is read at mount time and cached in memory.
+
+3.7 Export table
+----------------
+
+To enable Squashfs filesystems to be exportable (via NFS etc.) filesystems
+can optionally (disabled with the -no-exports Mksquashfs option) contain
+an inode number to inode disk location lookup table.  This is required to
+enable Squashfs to map inode numbers passed in filehandles to the inode
+location on disk, which is necessary when the export code reinstantiates
+expired/flushed inodes.
+
+This table is stored compressed into metadata blocks.  A second index table is
+used to locate these.  This second index table for speed of access (and because
+it is small) is read at mount time and cached in memory.
+
+3.8 Xattr table
+---------------
+
+The xattr table contains extended attributes for each inode.  The xattrs
+for each inode are stored in a list, each list entry containing a type,
+name and value field.  The type field encodes the xattr prefix
+("user.", "trusted." etc) and it also encodes how the name/value fields
+should be interpreted.  Currently the type indicates whether the value
+is stored inline (in which case the value field contains the xattr value),
+or if it is stored out of line (in which case the value field stores a
+reference to where the actual value is stored).  This allows large values
+to be stored out of line improving scanning and lookup performance and it
+also allows values to be de-duplicated, the value being stored once, and
+all other occurrences holding an out of line reference to that value.
+
+The xattr lists are packed into compressed 8K metadata blocks.
+To reduce overhead in inodes, rather than storing the on-disk
+location of the xattr list inside each inode, a 32-bit xattr id
+is stored.  This xattr id is mapped into the location of the xattr
+list using a second xattr id lookup table.
+
+4. TODOS AND OUTSTANDING ISSUES
+-------------------------------
+
+4.1 Todo list
+-------------
+
+Implement ACL support.
+
+4.2 Squashfs internal cache
+---------------------------
+
+Blocks in Squashfs are compressed.  To avoid repeatedly decompressing
+recently accessed data Squashfs uses two small metadata and fragment caches.
+
+The cache is not used for file datablocks, these are decompressed and cached in
+the page-cache in the normal way.  The cache is used to temporarily cache
+fragment and metadata blocks which have been read as a result of a metadata
+(i.e. inode or directory) or fragment access.  Because metadata and fragments
+are packed together into blocks (to gain greater compression) the read of a
+particular piece of metadata or fragment will retrieve other metadata/fragments
+which have been packed with it, these because of locality-of-reference may be
+read in the near future. Temporarily caching them ensures they are available
+for near future access without requiring an additional read and decompress.
+
+In the future this internal cache may be replaced with an implementation which
+uses the kernel page cache.  Because the page cache operates on page sized
+units this may introduce additional complexity in terms of locking and
+associated race conditions.

+	tristate "SquashFS 4.0 - Squashed file system support"
+	depends on BLOCK
+	help
+	  Saying Y here includes support for SquashFS 4.0 (a Compressed
+	  Read-Only File System).  Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only
+	  filesystem for Linux.  It uses zlib, lzo or xz compression to
+	  compress both files, inodes and directories.  Inodes in the system
+	  are very small and all blocks are packed to minimise data overhead.
+	  Block sizes greater than 4K are supported up to a maximum of 1 Mbytes
+	  (default block size 128K).  SquashFS 4.0 supports 64 bit filesystems
+	  and files (larger than 4GB), full uid/gid information, hard links and
+	  timestamps.
+
+	  Squashfs is intended for general read-only filesystem use, for
+	  archival use (i.e. in cases where a .tar.gz file may be used), and in
+	  embedded systems where low overhead is needed.  Further information
+	  and tools are available from http://squashfs.sourceforge.net.
+
+	  If you want to compile this as a module ( = code which can be
+	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want),
+	  say M here.  The module will be called squashfs.  Note that the root
+	  file system (the one containing the directory /) cannot be compiled
+	  as a module.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+
+config SQUASHFS_XATTR
+	bool "Squashfs XATTR support"
+	depends on SQUASHFS
+	help
+	  Saying Y here includes support for extended attributes (xattrs).
+	  Xattrs are name:value pairs associated with inodes by
+	  the kernel or by users (see the attr(5) manual page).
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+
+config SQUASHFS_ZLIB
+	bool "Include support for ZLIB compressed file systems"
+	depends on SQUASHFS
+	select ZLIB_INFLATE
+	help
+	  ZLIB compression is the standard compression used by Squashfs
+	  file systems.  It offers a good trade-off between compression
+	  achieved and the amount of CPU time and memory necessary to
+	  compress and decompress.
+
+	  If unsure, say Y.
+
+config SQUASHFS_LZO
+	bool "Include support for LZO compressed file systems"
+	depends on SQUASHFS
+	select LZO_DECOMPRESS
+	help
+	  Saying Y here includes support for reading Squashfs file systems
+	  compressed with LZO compression.  LZO compression is mainly
+	  aimed at embedded systems with slower CPUs where the overheads
+	  of zlib are too high.
+
+	  LZO is not the standard compression used in Squashfs and so most
+	  file systems will be readable without selecting this option.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+
+config SQUASHFS_XZ
+	bool "Include support for XZ compressed file systems"
+	depends on SQUASHFS
+	select XZ_DEC
+	help
+	  Saying Y here includes support for reading Squashfs file systems
+	  compressed with XZ compression.  XZ gives better compression than
+	  the default zlib compression, at the expense of greater CPU and
+	  memory overhead.
+
+	  XZ is not the standard compression used in Squashfs and so most
+	  file systems will be readable without selecting this option.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+
+config SQUASHFS_LZMA
+	bool "Include support for LZMA compressed file systems"
+	depends on SQUASHFS
+	default y
+
+config SQUASHFS_4K_DEVBLK_SIZE
+	bool "Use 4K device block size?"
+	depends on SQUASHFS
+	help
+	  By default Squashfs sets the dev block size (sb_min_blocksize)
+	  to 1K or the smallest block size supported by the block device
+	  (if larger).  This, because blocks are packed together and
+	  unaligned in Squashfs, should reduce latency.
+
+	  This, however, gives poor performance on MTD NAND devices where
+	  the optimal I/O size is 4K (even though the devices can support
+	  smaller block sizes).
+
+	  Using a 4K device block size may also improve overall I/O
+	  performance for some file access patterns (e.g. sequential
+	  accesses of files in filesystem order) on all media.
+
+	  Setting this option will force Squashfs to use a 4K device block
+	  size by default.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+
+config SQUASHFS_EMBEDDED
+	bool "Additional option for memory-constrained systems"
+	depends on SQUASHFS
+	help
+	  Saying Y here allows you to specify cache size.
+
+	  If unsure, say N.
+
+config SQUASHFS_FRAGMENT_CACHE_SIZE
+	int "Number of fragments cached" if SQUASHFS_EMBEDDED
+	depends on SQUASHFS
+	default "3"
+	help
+	  By default SquashFS caches the last 3 fragments read from
+	  the filesystem.  Increasing this amount may mean SquashFS
+	  has to re-read fragments less often from disk, at the expense
+	  of extra system memory.  Decreasing this amount will mean
+	  SquashFS uses less memory at the expense of extra reads from disk.
+
+	  Note there must be at least one cached fragment.  Anything
+	  much more than three will probably not make much difference.

+ * This file implements code to do filename lookup in directories.
+ *
+ * Like inodes, directories are packed into compressed metadata blocks, stored
+ * in a directory table.  Directories are accessed using the start address of
+ * the metablock containing the directory and the offset into the
+ * decompressed block (<block, offset>).
+ *
+ * Directories are organised in a slightly complex way, and are not simply
+ * a list of file names.  The organisation takes advantage of the
+ * fact that (in most cases) the inodes of the files will be in the same
+ * compressed metadata block, and therefore, can share the start block.
+ * Directories are therefore organised in a two level list, a directory
+ * header containing the shared start block value, and a sequence of directory
+ * entries, each of which share the shared start block.  A new directory header
+ * is written once/if the inode start block changes.  The directory
+ * header/directory entry list is repeated as many times as necessary.
+ *
+ * Directories are sorted, and can contain a directory index to speed up
+ * file lookup.  Directory indexes store one entry per metablock, each entry
+ * storing the index/filename mapping to the first directory header
+ * in each metadata block.  Directories are sorted in alphabetical order,
+ * and at lookup the index is scanned linearly looking for the first filename
+ * alphabetically larger than the filename being looked up.  At this point the
+ * location of the metadata block the filename is in has been found.
+ * The general idea of the index is ensure only one metadata block needs to be
+ * decompressed to do a lookup irrespective of the length of the directory.
+ * This scheme has the advantage that it doesn't require extra memory overhead
+ * and doesn't require much extra storage on disk.
