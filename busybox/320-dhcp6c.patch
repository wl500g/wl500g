+# Sample dhcp6c configuration file (/etc/dhcp6c.conf)
+# Values shown are defaults
+#
+# NB! Major limitation of busybox applet
+#  - both keyword & it's arguments MUST reside on the same line
+
+# Interface statement
+#  An interface statement specifies configuration parameters on the interface.
+#  The generic format of an interface statement is as follows:
+#
+#  interface interface { substatements };
+#     send send-options ;
+#			This statement specifies DHCPv6 options to be sent to the
+#			server(s).  Some options can only appear in particular
+#			messages according to the specification, in which case
+#			the appearance of the options is limited to be compliant
+#			with the specification.
+#
+#			send-options is a comma-separated list of options, each
+#			of which should be specified as described above. Multiple
+#			send statements can also be specified, in which case
+#			all the specified options will be sent.
+#
+#	rapid-commit
+#			When rapid-commit is specified, dhcp6c will include a
+#			rapid-commit option in solicit messages and wait for an
+#			immediate reply instead of advertisements.
+#	ia-pd ID
+#			When ia-pd is specified, dhcp6c will initiate prefix del-
+#			egation as a requesting router by including an IA_PD
+#			option with the specified ID in solicit messages.
+#	ia-na ID
+#			When ia-na is specified, dhcp6c will initiate stateful
+#			address assignment by including an IA_NA option with the
+#			specified ID in solicit messages.
+#	authentication authname
+#			means an authentication option. authname is a string specifying
+#			parameters of the authentication protocol. An authentication
+#			statement for authname must be provided.
+#			In either case, a corresponding identity association
+#			statement must exist with the same ID.
+#
+#     request request-options;
+#			This statement specifies DHCPv6 options to be included in
+#			an option-request option. request-options is a comma
+#			separated list of options, which can consist of the fol-
+#			lowing options.
+#
+#		domain-name-servers
+#			requests a list of Domain Name Server addresses.
+#		domain-name
+#			requests a DNS search path.
+#		ntp-servers
+#			requests a list of NTP server addresses. As of
+#			this writing, the option type for this option is
+#			not officially assigned. dhcp6c will reject this
+#			option unless it is explicitly built to accept
+#			the option.
+#		sip-server-address
+#			requests a list of SIP server addresses.
+#		sip-domain-name
+#			requests a SIP server domain name.
+#		nis-server-address
+#			requests a list of NIS server addresses.
+#		nis-domain-name
+#			requests a NIS domain name.
+#		nisp-server-address
+#			requests a list of NIS+ server addresses.
+#		nisp-domain-name
+#			requests a NIS+ domain name.
+#		bcmcs-server-address
+#			requests a list of BCMCS server addresses.
+#		bcmcs-domain-name
+#			requests a BCMCS domain name.
+#		refreshtime
+#			means an information refresh time option. This
+#			can only be specified when sent with information
+#			request messages; dhcp6c will ignore this option
+#			for other messages.
+#			Multiple request statements can also be specified, in
+#			which case all the specified options will be requested.
+#     information-only;
+#  			This statement specifies dhcp6c to only exchange informa-
+#			tional configuration parameters with servers. A list of
+#			DNS server addresses is an example of such parameters.
+#			This statement is useful when the client does not need
+#			stateful configuration parameters such as IPv6 addresses
+#			or prefixes.
+#     script "script-name";
+#			This statement specifies a path to script invoked by
+#			dhcp6c on a certain condition including when the daemon
+#			receives a reply message. script-name must be the absolute
+#			path from root to the script file, be a regular
+#			file, and be created by the same owner who runs the daemon.
+#
+# Identity association statement
+#  Identity association (IA) is a key notion of DHCPv6. An IA is uniquely
+#  identified in a client by a pair of IA type and IA identifier (IAID). An
+#  IA is associated with configuration information dependent on the IA type.
+#  An identity association statement defines a single IA with some client-
+#  side configuration parameters. Its format is as follows:
+#
+#  id-assoc type [ID] { substatements };
+#		type is a string for the type of this IA. The current implemen-
+#		tation supports <oq>na<cq> (non-temporary address allocation) <oq>pd<cq>
+#		(prefix delegation) for the IA type. ID is a decimal number of
+#		IAID. If omitted, the value 0 will be used by default.
+#		substatements is a sequence of statements that specifies configu-
+#		ration parameters for this IA. Each statement may or may not be
+#		specific to the type of IA.
+#
+#	The followings are possible substatements for an IA of type na.
+#     address ipv6-address pltime [vltime];
+#			specifies an address and related parameters that the
+#			client wants to be allocated. Multiple addresses can be
+#			specified, each of which is described as a separate
+#			address substatement. dhcp6c will include all the
+#			addresses (and related parameters) in Solicit messages,
+#			as an IA_NA prefix option encapsulated in the correspond-
+#			ing IA_NA option. Note, however, that the server may or
+#			may not respect the specified prefix parameters.
+#	The followings are possible substatements for an IA of type pd.
+#     prefix_interface_statement
+#			specifies the client's local configuration of how dele-
+#			gated prefixes should be used (see below).
+#     prefix ipv6-prefix pltime [vltime];
+#			specifies a prefix and related parameters that the client
+#			wants to be delegated. Multiple prefixes can be speci-
+#			fied, each of which is described as a separate prefix
+#			substatement. dhcp6c will include all the prefixes (and
+#			related parameters) in Solicit messages, as an IA_PD pre-
+#			fix option encapsulated in the corresponding IA_PD
+#			option. Note, however, that the server may or may not
+#			respect the specified prefix parameters.
+#
+# Prefix interface statement
+#  A prefix interface statement specifies configuration parameters of pre-
+#  fixes on local interfaces that are derived from delegated prefixes. A
+#  prefix interface statement can only appear as a substatement of an iden-
+#  tity association statement with the type pd. The generic format of an
+#  interface statement is as follows:
+#
+#  prefix-interface interface { substatements };
+#		When an IPv6 prefix is delegated from a DHCPv6 server, dhcp6c
+#		will assign a prefix on the interface unless the interface
+#		receives the DHCPv6 message that contains the prefix with the
+#		delegated prefix and the parameters provided in substatements.
+#		Possible substatements are as follows:
+#     sla-id ID ;
+#			This statement specifies the identifier value of the
+#			site-level aggregator (SLA) on the interface.
+#     sla-len length ;
+#			This statement specifies the length of the SLA ID in
+#			bits. length must be a decimal number between 0 and 128.
+#			If the length is not specified by this statement, the
+#			default value 16 will be used.
+#
+# Authentication statement
+#  An authentication statement defines a set of authentication parameters
+#  used in DHCPv6 exchanges with the server(s). The format of an authenti-
+#  cation statement is as follows:
+#
+#  authentication authname { substatements };
+#		authname is a string which is unique among all authentication
+#		statements in the configuration file. It will specify a particu-
+#		lar set of authentication parameters when authentication option
+#		is specified in the interface statement. Possible substatements
+#		of the authentication statement are as follows:
+#     protocol authprotocol ;
+#			specifies the authentication protocol. Currently, the
+#			only available protocol as authprotocol is delayed, which
+#			means the DHCPv6 delayed authentication protocol.
+#     algorithm authalgorithm ;
+#			specifies the algorithm for this authentication. Cur-
+#			rently, the only available algorithm is HMAC-MD5, which
+#			can be specified as one of the followings: hmac-md5,
+#			HMAC-MD5, hmacmd5, or HMACMD5. This substatement can be
+#			omitted. In this case, HMAC-MD5 will be used as the
+#			algorithm.
+#     rdm replay-detection-method ;
+#			specifies the replay protection method for this authenti-
+#			cation. Currently, the only available method is
+#			monocounter, which means the use of a monotonically
+#			increasing counter. If this method is specified, dhcp6c
+#			will use an NTP-format timestamp when it authenticates
+#			the message. This substatement can be omitted, in which
+#			case monocounter will be used as the method.
+#
+# Keyinfo statement
+#  A keyinfo statement defines a secret key shared with the server(s) to
+#  authenticate DHCPv6 messages. The format of a keyinfo statement is as
+#  follows:
+#
+#  keyinfo keyname { substatements };
+#		keyname is an arbitrary string. It does not affect client's
+#		behavior but is provided for readability of log messages. Possi-
+#		ble substatements of the keyinfo statement are as follows:
+#     realm "realmname" ;
+#			specifies the DHCP realm. realmname is an arbitrary
+#			string, but is typically expected to be a domain name
+#			like "kame.net" .
+#     keyid ID ;
+#			specifies the key identifier, ID, as a decimal number. A
+#			secret key is uniquely identified within the client by
+#			the DHCP realm and the key identifier.
+#     secret "secret-value" ;
+#			specifies the shared secret of this key. "secret-value"
+#			is a base-64 encoded string of the secret.
+#     expire "expiration-time" ;
+#			specifies the expiration time of this key.
+#			"expiration-time" should be formatted in one of the fol-
+#			lowings: yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM, mm-dd HH:MM, or HH:MM, where
+#			yyyy is the year with century (e.g., 2004), mm is the
+#			month, dd is the day of the month, HH is the hour of
+#			24-hour clock, and MM is the minute, each of which is
+#			given as a decimal number. Additionally, a special key-
+#			word forever can be specified as expiration-time, which
+#			means the key has an infinite lifetime and never expires.
+#			This substatement can be omitted, in which case forever
+#			will be used by default.
